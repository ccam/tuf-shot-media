## Description
This is a simple portfolio site for a photography friend. He wanted something super simple that would pretty much just link to his other sites while showing off some of his work.

NOTE: the /docs folder is only for gh-pages

## Explanation 
###Design
The design was inspired from [this dribble.](https://dribbble.com/shots/2052887-Moverec)


##Code 
####HTML
The HTML is pretty basic and self-explanatory.

####CSS
The CSS ways pretty simple. Just position the images and space the text. 

I decided to not break up the page into sections but rather have one file for the base CSS and one file for the media queries. That way I could have three panels open in my editor; one for the HTML, one for the default CSS, and one for media queries.
